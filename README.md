You can add items to your list from your custom catalogs or you can also add items manually if you are too lazy to look for the item.

This the part where you can add group of items and add sub items to them respectively. Here i ve used expandable recycler view for the
convinience of the user. User can select his list items from here and the selected item gets highlighted after getting the quantity from
the user.

This is how the list will look after adding the items, the items that are bought can be selected and they'll get highlighted and will
automatically go at the bottom. For all kinds of lists in the app i ve used recycler view and a single custom adapter for each one of them
